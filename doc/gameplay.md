# Gameplay

The game has a few states.

## Deck Building

Using your collection of cards, build a deck consisting of 40 cards. At most,
3 copies of a single card can exist in the deck.

## Pack Opening

Spend points to open card packs. Card rarities can be common, uncommon, rare,
and secret. Each pack has 8 cards. The chances for each card are:

- Common: 70%
- Uncommon: 20%
- Rare: 8%
- Secret: 2%

There will be multiple card packs that get more expensive and contain stronger
cards. Since this is an incremental, and battles are mostly RNG, power is more
important than strategy.

## Opponent Choice

Choose from opponents to challenge. Beat easier opponents a certain number of
times to unlock harder ones.

## Battles

Battles progress through phases: Draw, Place, Battle, End.

### Draw

For the first turn, both players draw 5 cards. Following turns draw 1 card,
unless otherwise noted by a card effect.

### Place

All cards in the hand that can be placed on the field are placed. Each player
has a single field that holds any number of any card type.

### Battle

Creature cards have power and health. Unless noted otherwise, attacking cards
will go after the opponent's health directly. The opponent's cards will defend
against any direct attack. Defensive choices are made to prioritize survival.
Attacks can target a creature if an effect says so, like targeting the
strongest or weakest creature.

### End

Run any card effects that take place in the End phase.
